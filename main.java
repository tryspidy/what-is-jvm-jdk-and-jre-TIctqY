JVM:
1.	JVM is an abstract machine. 
    Because it doesn't physically exist.
2.	It is a very important part of both JDK
     and JRE because it is inbuilt in both. 
3.	Whatever Java program we want to run, goes into JVM. 
4.	And JVM is responsible for loading,
    verifying and executing the java program 
    line by line hence it is also known as interpreter.
    
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development 
environment used for developing Java applications. 
It includes:
	Java Virtual Machine, 
	Java Runtime Environment,
	Loader, 
	Java compiler, 
	Documentation generator 
	Archiver (jar), 
	Other tools needed in Java development.
    
 Java Runtime Environment :
	It physically exists. 
	The Java Runtime Environment provides
    the minimum requirements such as libraries
    and Class Loader for executing a 
    Java application on JVM. 
	It consists of the Java Virtual Machine
    core classes, and supporting files.
